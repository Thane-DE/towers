DO:

- hanoi.c: Add a proper error-cheking whether values are actually integers or not.
- hanoi.c  Allow for more than single-digit values



OPTIONAL:
- hanoi.c: Fix the workaround so that it is now possible for nodes to start with something other than 1
	The program works with all numbers, but it only displays 1-so and so.

DONE:
- hanoic.: Something, something, recursive, something
- hanoi.c: Correct node number
- single_linked_stack.c: VALGRIND all the things!
